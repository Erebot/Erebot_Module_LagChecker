"The delay (in seconds) between two consecutive lag checks. This should not be "
"set to high to avoir risking a disconnection due to a timeout between checks "
"(thus defeating the whole point of this module). However, it should not be "
"set too low either to avoid flooding the IRC server with lag checks. A delay "
"of 60 seconds (1 minute) seems reasonable."

msgid ""
"The delay the bot will wait after disconnecting from an IRC server due to "
"high latency before an attempt is made to reconnect. This is meant to delay "
"operations a little so that the latency gets lower and to implement some kind "
"of \"reconnection throttling\". You should probably set this to a value "
"higher or equal to the value for the ``check`` option."

msgid "timeout"
msgstr ""
#
msgid ""
"The number of seconds the bot will wait for a response after it sends a "
"periodic latency check. If no response is received by then, this module will "
"consider the connection to be unresponsive and will (possibly forcefully) "
"disconnect the bot from the associated IRC server. You may set this to a low "
"value on broadband connections (eg. 5 seconds)."

msgid ""
"In this example, we configure the bot to check the latency every 2 minutes "
"(120 seconds). The IRC server has 15 seconds to respond to our latency "
"checks. If it does not answer by then, the bot will disconnect from that IRC "
"server and will wait for another full minute before attempting a "
"reconnection. Moreover, the command \"!latency\" can be used at any time to "
"display the current latency."
