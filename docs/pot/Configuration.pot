msgid "The delay (in seconds) between two consecutive lag checks. This should not be set to high to avoir risking a disconnection due to a timeout between checks (thus defeating the whole point of this module). However, it should not be set too low either to avoid flooding the IRC server with lag checks. A delay of 60 seconds (1 minute) seems reasonable."

This is meant to delay operations a little so that the latency gets lower and to implement some kind of \"reconnection throttling\". You should probably set this to a value higher or equal to the value for the ``check`` option."

If it does not answer by then, the bot will disconnect from that IRC server and will wait for another full minute before attempting a reconnection. Moreover, the command \"!latency\" can be used at any time to display the current latency."
